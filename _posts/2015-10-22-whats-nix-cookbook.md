title: What's the Nix cookbook?
---

This is a cookbook-style teaching tool to show how to write Nix expressions
for the purposes of packaging, system configuration, provisioning,
orchestrated deployment, CI jobs, etc.

Here is some introductory material to get you started:

* [Nix By Example](/nix-by-example/)
* [NixOS By Example](/nixos-by-example/)
* [NixOps By Example](/nixops-by-example/)

More to come soon!
