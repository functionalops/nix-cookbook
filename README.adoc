## Nix Cookbook

A collection of Nix expressions and snippets that show you how you can get
common tasks done in Nix.

Target audience are those that have read the
link:http://nixos.org/nix/manual/[Nix Manual] and found it great reference
material but need more examples to be more productive with the following
toolset:

* link:http://nixos.org/nix/[Nix]
* link:http://nixos.org/nixos/[NixOS]
* link:http://nixos.org/nixops/[NixOps]
* link:http://nixos.org/hydra/[Hydra]
* link:http://nixos.org/disnix/[Disnix]

### Prerequisites

I recommend Nix 1.9+ (although most exercises should work in 1.8) and
installing `nix-repl`:

[source,shell]
----
$ nix-env -i nix-repl
----

Alternatively just start the `nix-shell` at the root of this repository:

[source,shell]
----
$ nix-shell
----

### Basics

To get started doing warmups the following snippets provide examples and
exercises to get acquainted with the different builtin types in the Nix
expression language.
